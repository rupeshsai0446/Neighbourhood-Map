# Neighbourhood-Map

## Description

My Project neighbourhood map is about showing the  Top rated places in India. When we click on the marker of that location then a infowindow is opened showing the links related to that location along with an image of that location.

## Installation

Either clone the repository using GIT, or use the download ZIP link on the right hand side of the screen.  Double click the index.html file. You need to have a working internet connection for the app to work because it draws information from Google Maps and Foursquare.
